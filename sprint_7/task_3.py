# Imagine you are creating an application that shows the data about all different types of vehicles present. 
# It takes the data from APIs of different vehicle organizations in XML format and then displays the information.
# But suppose at some time you want to upgrade your application with a Machine Learning algorithms that work beautifully on the data and fetch the important data only. 
# But there is a problem, it takes data in JSON format only.
# It will be a really poor approach to make changes in Machine Learning Algorithm so that it will take data in XML format.

# For solving the problem we defined above, you can use Adapter Method that helps by creating an Adapter object.
# To use an adapter in your code:

# Client should make a request to the adapter by calling a method on it using the target interface.
# Using the Adaptee interface, the Adapter should translate that request on the adaptee.
# Result of the call is received the client and he/she is unaware of the presence of the Adapter’s presence.
